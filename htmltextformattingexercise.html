    <h1>Chocolate</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Chocolate is a usually sweet, brown food preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds 
        that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient
         in other foods. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Olmecs (modern day Mexico),
          with evidence of chocolate beverages dating to 1900 BC.
          The majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs.
          The word "chocolate" is derived from the Spanish word chocolate, which in turn derive from the
           Classical Nahuatl word xocolātl.</p>
